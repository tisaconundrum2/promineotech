# Week 8: Research

#### 1. What is CSS clearfix, how is it used, and why is it helpful?
The CSS clearfix is a property that allows an element to be vertically aligned within another element and is helpful when the floated elements must have a uniform height, so they donâ€™t stack up on top of each other.

#### 2. What are SaSS and LESS?
SaSS and LESS are CSS pre-processors, which means that they allow you to write CSS in a fashion that is more similar to how programming languages are written. When writing in SaSS or LESS, your stylesheets are processed by an application called a compiler. The result of this processing is an optimized version of the original code which can be used as regular CSS. LESS is a preprocessor for CSS and Sass is a CSS extension language. Whereas, CSS can only be written in one way, both LESS and Sass allow you to leverage variables, functions, mixins and other tools to make writing stylesheets easier.

#### 3. What is your favorite thing you learned this week?
It was interesting to learn about Clearfix. I've never found myself using it in my day to day, but now that I know about it. I might begin implementing it.
