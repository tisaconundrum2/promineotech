Welcome to the  Week 6:  Unit Final Project for JavaScript

NOTE:  All of these details are included in the Coding Assignment Document

Preview:
This final JavaScript project is an automated version of the classic card game WAR.  
- As a part of this assignment, you will also be asked to consider:
-- Creating classes such as Card, Deck & Player
-- Keeping in mind what fields and methods each class might have.

- The completed project will do the following:

-- Deal 26 Cards to 2 Players from a Deck
-- Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card
--- Award a point to the Player with the higher Card
--- Ties result in zero points for both Players
-- After all cards have been played, display the score and declare the winner.

- Finally, you will be asked to write a Unit Test using Mocha and Chai for at least one of your functions
