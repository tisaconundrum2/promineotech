# Week 11: Research

#### 1. What does the `fetch()` method do? How can it be used instead of an AJAX call?
The `fetch()` method is a modern way to make HTTP requests in JavaScript. It is part of the browser's Fetch API, which provides an interface for fetching resources.

You can use `fetch()` to send an HTTP request to a server and retrieve data in response. It returns a promise that resolves to the response of the request.

#### 2. In JQuery, what does it mean to "traverse the DOM"?
To traverse the DOM means to move through the DOM tree, starting at a particular element and then exploring its children, grandchildren, and so on. You can traverse the DOM using methods such as `.children()`, `.find()`, `.parent()`, `.siblings()`, and others in the jQuery library. These methods allow you to select elements that are related to the current element in some way, such as its descendants, ancestors, siblings, or others. You can then perform operations on the selected elements, such as changing their style, modifying their content, or reacting to events. Traversing the DOM is a key feature of jQuery and is one of the things that makes it so powerful for working with HTML and CSS.

#### 3. What is your favorite thing you learned this week?
I didn't know that there were specific ways to traverse the DOM. I usually only specifically called the DOM I needed, but from a programatic point of view this makes a lot of sense why there is so much value in this
