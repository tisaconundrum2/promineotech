Assume that you have an array of customer objects like this:

[
  {
    firstName: "Sam",
    lastName: "Smith",
    email: "sam.smith@gmail.com"
  },
  {
    firstName: "Tom",
    lastName: "Jones",
    email: "tom.jones@gmail.com"
  },
......
]

[x] Also, assume your HTML contains a table with an id of "customer-table"
