Explanation: 
    Heavy use and guidance from Geeks for Geeks implementation, 
    **BUT** the script.js is completely mine. I utilized some of what GG had offered, but felt that the code could be optimized more.
    Basically, I took what they had and ran with it. 
    
    The biggest changes can be found in `isWinCheck()` and `validateConfiguration()`; functions which seek to simplify and clean up code offered by GG. 
    I found that repeated code was heavily used here, and I needed to optimize it if it could be helped.
    
    I will say that I had the chance to learn more about how `.some()` could be used to check for truthy and falsey values within many possible outputs.
    This method will prove a very useful in the future if I have to come across some kind of matrix manipulation again in JS.

    I'm proud of this work, it's not a lot but I think it showcases several code design philosophies that make the overall script more readable.
