Video Steps:
• Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works with an emphasis on the portions you contributed.
• This video should be done using screen share and voice over.
• This can easily be done using Zoom, although you don't have to use Zoom, it's just what we recommend.
o You can create a new meeting, start screen sharing, and start recording.
o This will create a video recording on your computer.
• This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube.
o Ensure the link you share isPUBLIC or UNLISTED!
o If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what they can access.
