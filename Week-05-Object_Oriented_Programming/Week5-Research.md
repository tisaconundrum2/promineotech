# Week 5 Research:

### 1. What are the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming? Explain each pillar.

- Abstraction
Abstraction is in a nute shell only showing the necessary details. It completely cuts out all the the technical and leaves a user with just the necessary that they need to concern themselves with..

- Encapsulation
Is in the act of enclosing something. Encapsulation can be used to hide funcitonality, or features. 

- Inheritance
Inheritance is the act of letting an  object acquire the properties and methods of another object.
Reusability is the main benefit here. We know sometimes that multiple places need to do the same thing, and they need to do everything the same except for one small part. This is a problem inheritance can solve.

- Polymorphism
