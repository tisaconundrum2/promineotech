# Week 9: Research

### 1. Name 5 different Bootstrap components and describe how they work.
#### Accordion
The Bootstrap accordion is used to create a collapsible, toggleable menu that can be used to organize and navigate content on a website. The accordion is typically composed of a series of panels, each of which can be expanded or collapsed by clicking on a header element. 

#### Breadcrumb
The Bootstrap breadcrumb is a navigation component that used to create a hierarchy of links that indicates the current location within a website. The breadcrumb typically appears at the top of a page, above the main content, and is composed of a series of links that allow users to easily navigate back to previous pages or sections within the website. 

#### Modal
The Bootstrap modal is a component that is used to create a popup window or dialog box to display additional content on a website. The modal is typically triggered by a button or link on the page, and it appears in a separate window overlaid on top of the main page content. 

#### Offcanvas
Offcanvas is a feature in the Bootstrap that allows developers to create a sliding panel of content that can be revealed from the edge of the screen. This is commonly used to create a mobile-friendly navigation menu.

#### Popover
A popover is a small overlay of content that is displayed when the user clicks on or hovers over a specific element on a website. It is used to provide additional information or options that are related to the element that the popover is attached to.

### 2. How does the Bootstrap grid system work?
The Bootstrap grid system is a set of pre-defined classes and styles that are used to create a flexible and responsive layout for a website. It is part of the Bootstrap front-end framework, and it is designed to make it easy for developers to create a layout that will adapt to the size and orientation of the user's device.

### 3. What is your favorite thing you learned this week?
My favorite thing that I learned this week is all of the various components that are available in Bootstrap. It never occured to me that there was a name for these things, I just always assumed them to be stylings, and that was the end of it. A means to an end as it were. I will defintely need to look more at these other avilable components and see what I can do with them.
