# Week 9: Coding Assignment Submission
## ðŸš¨Â Special Notes

    For this project and all remaining projects , you should also have a file calledÂ .gitignoreÂ in your project directory. In that file you should have a line that says "/node_modules" without the quotes. This tells git to ignore all your node module dependencies when it pushes code to your repo.

    You should also have a file calledÂ package.jsonÂ in your project directory. Please make sure this file gets pushed to your Github repo with all your other project files. This file is a manifest or list of all dependencies that your project requires to function properly. With this file someone can clone your repo and then run "npm install" in the project directory and they will automatically download all the node module dependencies needed.

    In particular the graders will be cloning your repo (using git cloneÂ https://github.com/YourUserName/YourRepoName) and then installing all the dependencies (using npm install). They can then test your project locally on their machine. It is recommended you run these commands at least for this project to make sure you can clone and run your project locally. If you have trouble doing that, please ask for help before submitting it.Â 


## MacOS Users:  if you run into permissions errors when installing http-server you may need to run the command like this:

`sudo npm install -g http-server`

At which point you will be prompted for your password. Go ahead and enter your password (even though it looks like nothing is happening) and then press enter.Â
