##### What is your greatest professional achievement?(STAR)

I was part of a company called Logicor that focused on providing a piece of software that would make it easier for companies to process packages quickly and efficiently. There was a particular company that called in about a persistent issue where package information from our system wouldn't make it to theirs. This issue was introducing many roadblocks in their process and was casting them time and money. I found that issue present was with their pollers and how it was collecting the information it needed into their SFTP. There was a bug in our software that was causing files to be needlessly deleted before their pollers could actually collect the files. I was able to go in and resolve this issue using Javascript and VBScript ensuring that the SFTP had successfully collected the necessary files. By introducing this feature I was able to save the company $31,000 a year.

I feel that this company, given it's track record, would allow me to continue growing in this technology while still doing what I do best, which is solving problems.

I really have appreciated the time I've spent at my current role, but I am looking to pivot and refocus on what I'm good at which is C# .NET. The current infrastructure is built using PHP for Wordpress and while I am familiar with the language, I do want to refocus my efforts on the language I've spent the most time in.

I would like to learn more about the role and the budget you have in mind and what the current range may be.
