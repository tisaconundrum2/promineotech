## Instructions

As developers, research is a constant part of our job. A common saying is that 90% of software development is Googling, and while that is an exaggeration, Google is a highly used tool in the role. This Research assignment is meant to go beyond the course curriculum and increase your understanding of relevant topics while exposing you to online resources you'll frequently use on the job. Please write a paragraph for two (2) of the above prompts and include URLs from where you found the information to cite your sources. Do not copy and paste text from the internet or any other source; use the information you find in your research, summarize, in your own words, the concepts. Plagiarism will result in a zero for the assignment as well as disciplinary actions.

### This assignment is graded based on participation.

### Create a .pdf file with your research findings:
- To save as a .pdf, go to Save As or Export, then choose the file type .pdf. This will save a new version of your document as a .pdf.
- If you have a Mac and use Pages, please make sure to export the final version of the document to a .pdf before submitting.
