# Week 4: Research

### 1. What are the differences between var, let, and const?
Before we talk about each of these, there are a few things that must be covered first. 
First lets talk about scope. Scope is where variables are available for use. Scoping can be global or function/local. This is important `var` and `let` have entirely different scoping.
Next we need to cover hoisting. Hoisting is a mechanism within Javascript that takes a variable or even a function declaration and moves them to the top of scoping. In other words if you declare a variable after you had already `console.log`ed it out it will run as if you had declared it before. Simply put, order does not matter if hoisting is available.

`var` used to be the standard way to instantiate a variable but it came with several caveats, as mentioned above, it had issues with scoping and hoisting. 

`var` is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.
